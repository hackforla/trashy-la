# trashy-la

How do we address the problem of trash on our streets?  One idea we had is first finding out where the trash cans are.  The city has the data, but how do we make it easier for people to use?  What can we discover if we cross this data with data on litter?

Maybe we can eventually tie this into creating a plogging group.  :)
